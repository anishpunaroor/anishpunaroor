# Hello, I’m Anish Punaroor! 

I'm an incoming third year computer engineering major at UC San Diego. 

Recently, I've been working on full-stack web and game development projects.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy going on hikes, spending time with my cats, and cooking food for my friends and family. Thanks for viewing my profile!


## Current Involvements

- I am an instructor at theCoderSchool, where I teach clients programming concepts and introduce them to game development in languages such as Java, Python,, and Lua.
