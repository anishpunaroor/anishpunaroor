# Hello, I’m Anish Punaroor! 

I'm a third year computer engineering major at [UC San Diego](https://ece.ucsd.edu/). 

Recently, I've been working on web (front-end and full-stack) and game development projects.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy going on hikes, spending time with my cats, and cooking food for my friends and family. Thanks for viewing my profile!


## Involvements

- Currently, I am an instructor at [theCoderSchool](https://www.thecoderschool.com/), where I teach clients programming concepts and introduce them to game and web development in languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and Lua. 
- I was an instuctional assistant for UCSD's CSE department, tutoring students on data structures and sorting algorithms in Java.
