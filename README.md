<!-- # Hello, I’m Anish Punaroor! 

I'm a third year computer engineering major at [UC San Diego](https://ece.ucsd.edu/). 

Outside of school and work, I enjoy going on hikes, spending time with my cats, and cooking food for my friends and family.


## Involvements

- Currrently I am developing a React Native mobile application for Niiti, a Chicago-based startup. 

- I am an instructor at [theCoderSchool](https://www.thecoderschool.com/), where I teach clients programming concepts and introduce them to game and web development in languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and Lua.   -->
